# Parallel Programing Assignments

This repository contains implementations for various parallel computing assignments, designed to help understand and apply parallel processing techniques for performance and scalability. Below are descriptions of each assignment and their respective learning goals and technical implementations.

## HW1: Parallel Odd-Even Sort with MPI

This assignment introduces **Message Passing Interface (MPI)** by implementing a parallel odd-even sort algorithm.

- **Objective:** Implement the parallel odd-even sort algorithm and evaluate its performance and scalability.
- **Tasks:**
  - Experimentally evaluate the implementation to analyze performance and scalability.
  - Apply performance optimizations and parallel computing techniques for potential extra credit.

## HW2: Parallel Mandelbrot Set Computation

This assignment focuses on parallelizing a sequential Mandelbrot Set computation, aiming to build familiarity with both **Pthread** and **OpenMP** for thread-based parallelism, as well as hybrid parallelism using a combination of process and thread-based approaches.

- **Objective:** Parallelize the Mandelbrot Set computation while balancing workload across threads.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Gain experience with **Pthread** and **OpenMP** for thread programming.
  - Implement hybrid parallelism by combining processes and threads.
  - Develop an understanding of load balancing in parallel computing.

## HW3: Accelerated All-Pairs Shortest Path with CUDA
